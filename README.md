## What is BUS/RT

BUS/RTÂ® is a Rust-native IPC broker, written in Rust/Tokio, inspired by
[NATS](https://nats.io), [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org) and
[Nanomsg](https://nanomsg.org). BUS/RT is fast, flexible and very easy to use.

The library can be embedded in any Rust project or be used as a standalone
server.

BUS/RT is the core bus of [EVA ICS v4](https://www.eva-ics.com/).

## Inter-process communication

The following communication patterns are supported out-of-the-box:

* one-to-one messages
* one-to-many messages
* pub/sub

The following channels are supported:

* async channels between threads/futures (Rust only)
* UNIX sockets (local machine, Linux/BSD)
* TCP sockets (Linux/BSD/Windows)

In addition to Rust, BUS/RT has also bindings for the following languages:

* Python (sync): <https://pypi.org/project/busrt/>
* Python (async): <https://pypi.org/project/busrt-async/>
* JavaScript (Node.js): <https://www.npmjs.com/package/busrt>
* Dart <https://github.com/AndreiLosev/busrt_client>
